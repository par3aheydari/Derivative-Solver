# Derivative Solver

A simple **HTML/CSS/JS** project to calculate the **derivative of polynomials** and plot the function and its derivative on a graph.

---

## Features

- Compute derivatives of polynomial functions (`ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ...`)  
- Display derivative in readable format  
- Plot both the original function and its derivative  
- Red/black theme with animated background  
- Fully client-side, no backend required  

---

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.  
2. Enter your polynomial in the input box (e.g., `3*x^2 + 2*x + 1`).  
3. Click **Solve**.  
4. The derivative will appear below the input.  
5. The canvas will show the graph of both the function (orange) and its derivative (green).
